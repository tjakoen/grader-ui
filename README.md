> A hosted review surface for the [GitHub-Native Course Platform](https://github.com/tjakoen/github-native-course-platform). It reads your teacher repos' gradebooks **live from the GitHub API in your browser**, shows one review dashboard, and generates the prompts an AI runs to apply your decisions. You review and decide; the AI does the typing.

The platform grades take-home and in-lab work with an AI, then *holds every AI grade for review*. This is where that review happens. AI-proposed grades and feedback show up in *grain* type; the moment you approve or edit one, it flips to *clean* type. Provenance is visible in the page itself, which is the one idea [GRAIN](https://tjakoen.github.io/grain) exists to make real.

## Data-free by design

The deployed page is an empty shell. **No student data is ever baked into it or stored on any server.** When you open it, it fetches your gradebooks straight from `api.github.com` using a read-only token you paste into Settings, which lives only in your own browser's localStorage. Nothing else leaves the page: the strict Content-Security-Policy allows exactly one outbound host, `api.github.com`. A deploy-time tripwire fails the build if any gradebook data sneaks into the artifact.

## Why prompts, not an in-app grade write

The dashboard doesn't apply grades itself. It *generates a prompt* holding every decision you made, and Claude Code does the actual git and gh writes back in the repo. That review gate is the whole design: you see every intent before it runs. The one thing the browser writes is the prompt file itself, under `gradebook/intents/`, so a local "run pending intents" picks it up without any copy-paste. (Every prompt drawer still has a Copy button if you'd rather paste it yourself.)

## How to use it (you review, the AI applies)

1. **Connect.** First open shows Settings. Paste your teacher repo URLs (one per line) and a fine-grained GitHub PAT scoped to just those repos. Both stay in this browser only.
2. **Review.** Open the AI Review tab. Each held grade shows the automated score, the AI-proposed score in grain type, the screenshots or code (fetched on demand), and two feedback boxes (student-facing prose and instructor-only notes). Approve, override the score, flag for a closer look, or edit the text. Editing flips it from grain to clean, because now a human wrote it. Decisions are saved in your browser and can be exported/imported as a JSON backup.
3. **Send the intent.** Hit a Generate prompt button, then **Send to repo →**. The prompt lands as `gradebook/intents/<timestamp>-<kind>.md` in the teacher repo. It holds every decision you made, and blanks anything you flagged or skipped so it stays out of both the student publish and the Canvas push.
4. **Run it locally.** In a Claude Code session opened in the teacher repo, say "run the pending intents." The AI reads the intent file, does the writing (the gradebook, the feedback files, the Canvas push), and archives the intent. You watch it happen and keep the final say. Hit **Refresh** to see the result.

Nothing reaches a student or Canvas from a grade you did not review. The exact prompts it emits are catalogued in [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md); the full walkthrough is in [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

## Structure

```
site/       the hosted app (static shell + ES modules)
  index.html      shell, CSP, no CDN
  app.mjs         the dashboard UI (ported from the retired local build)
  app.css         layout on top of GRAIN
  theme.css       baked from @tjakoen/grain at deploy time (gitignored)
  lib/            gh (API adapter), gradebook, config, shots, code, store
scripts/    bake-theme.mjs - inlines the GRAIN theme into site/theme.css
src/        maintenance tools (audit, fix, blanks) that scan a local classes/
lib/        config.mjs - section discovery for the maintenance tools
docs/       grain-for-ai, commands, usage
```

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install          # pulls @tjakoen/grain (the theme) from GitHub Packages
npm run dev          # bakes the theme, then serves site/ on a local port
```

The look comes from the `@tjakoen/grain` design-system package. The Pages workflow bakes it into `site/theme.css` at deploy time; the committed *.npmrc* points `@tjakoen` at GitHub Packages, which needs a token even for public packages. For local dev, add one line to your own *~/.npmrc* (never committed) with a PAT or `gh auth token` that has `read:packages`:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Your token

Use a **fine-grained personal access token** scoped to only your teacher repos, with **Contents: Read and write** (read for the gradebooks; write only so the app can file intent prompts under `gradebook/intents/`) and **Metadata: Read**. Give it a short expiry. It never leaves your browser, and the only host the page can reach is `api.github.com`.

## Status

Live, used to review real course grades. The deployed shell holds no data; the gradebooks it reads and the intents it files live in your teacher repos, and the token that reaches them lives only in your browser.
